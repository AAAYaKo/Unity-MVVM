# Unity-MVVM
Simple, Lightweight MVVM Framework for Unity3D

For a background on MVVM checkout the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel)

The goal of this project is to implement some of the concepts I knew and loved from developing WPF applications, mainly that they be very quick to build, and easy to maintain. It also attempts to solve some of the Unity-specific pain points I've uncovered over the last few years working with Unity.


Open to feedback and PRs. Better documentation coming soon.
